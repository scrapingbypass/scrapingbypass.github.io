In today's digital age, there are a large number of information resources on the Internet, and our task is to obtain valuable information from this massive data. However, with the continuous improvement of network security awareness, many websites have adopted CC protection measures to protect themselves from malicious attacks. At the same time, in order to avoid being blocked or restricted by the website, we need to use anonymous IP to crawl.

### CC protection limits IP
CC protection is a common network security measure used to prevent DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks against websites. Its principle is to protect the server from overloading by detecting and filtering an abnormally large number of requests from specific IP addresses. While CC protection is critical to website security, it can also have an impact on legitimate crawlers. In my practice, I have encountered some websites because of CC protection settings, which caused me to be unable to obtain data normally, frequently returning verification codes or denying access.

### The necessity of crawler anonymous IP
Facing the limitation of CC protection, using anonymous IP has become our common method. Anonymous IP refers to hiding the real IP address and accessing it through a proxy server, thus protecting the identity of crawlers to a certain extent. The advantage of using an anonymous IP is that it avoids frequent replacement of IP addresses and reduces the risk of being blocked or restricted by the website. In addition, anonymous IP can also reduce the probability of being detected by anti-crawler technology to a certain extent, and improve the stability and reliability of crawlers.

### Choose the right crawler anonymous IP
Choosing the right crawler anonymous IP is crucial. First of all, we need to ensure that the proxy IP used is highly anonymous, that is, the real IP address will not be revealed when passing the request. Secondly, the stability and reliability of the proxy IP are also factors that need to be considered. An unstable proxy IP may cause request failure or response delay. In addition, we also need to pay attention to the geographical location of the proxy IP to ensure that it has a better response speed when we crawl the target website.

### ScrapingBypass API side job advice
In actual crawling work, using the third-party ScrapingBypass API can greatly simplify the management and use of anonymous IPs. The [ScrapingBypass](https://www.scrapingbypass.com/) API provides a stable proxy IP ser****vice, which can automatically switch IPs according to needs, avoiding the tedious operation of manually changing IPs. At the same time, the ScrapingBypass API also supports global high-anonymity proxy IPs, ensuring the anonymity and stability of crawlers. We can use the ScrapingBypass API to improve work efficiency and focus more on data acquisition and processing without having to worry too much about IP being banned.

Using the ScrapingBypass API, you can easily bypass Cloudflare's anti-crawler robot verification, even if you need to send 100,000 requests, you don't have to worry about being identified as a scraper.

A ScrapingBypass API can break through all anti-anti-bot robot inspections, easily [bypass Cloudflare](https://www.scrapingbypass.com/), CAPTCHA verification, WAF, CC protection, and provide HTTP API and Proxy, including interface address, request parameters, return processing; and set Referer, browse Browser fingerprinting device features such as browser UA and headless status.
